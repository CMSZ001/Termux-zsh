# MyTermuxSetup
My personal termux setup, a bit modernized terminal :)

**What it does?:** 
- Installs zsh and sets it as default shell.
- Installs user selectable zsh framework from available options (1) zplugin, (2) oh-my-zsh, (3) Prezto for plugins and themes.
- Installs Powerlevel9k theme and prepatched SourceCodePro font as default.
- Added fonts and colors in ~/.termux/ directory with scripts to change them easily.
- Installs syntax highlighter and autosuggestion plugins.
- Disable unnecessary infos on right and left prompts.
- Enable double line left prompt with diffrent icons for dir, git and vcs, beautified left command prompt a bit, enabled new line after prompt.
- Replace termux's default welcome message with a better looking one.
