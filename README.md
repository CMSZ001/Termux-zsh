**What it does?:** 
- Installs zsh and sets it as default shell.
- Installs and sets precustomized Prezto as default 
- ~~Installs user selectable zsh framework from available options (1) zplugin, (2) oh-my-zsh, (3) Prezto for plugins and themes.~~ (Dropped)
- Installs Powerlevel10k theme and prepatched SourceCodePro font as default.
- Added fonts and colors in ~/.termux/ directory with scripts to change them easily.
- Installs syntax highlighter and autosuggestion plugins.
- Disable unnecessary infos on right and left prompts.
- Enable double line left prompt with diffrent icons for dir, git and vcs, beautified left command prompt a bit, enabled new line after prompt.
- Replace termux's default welcome message with a better looking one.
- Install static lf binary (Terminal file manager), press CTRL+O to execute lf in current directory.
- Inbuilt transfer function(transfer.sh) to transfer files easily, do transfer (file.example) to upload the file and get the download link.
