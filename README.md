# MyTermuxSetup
My personal termux setup, a bit modernized terminal :)

**What it does?:** 
- Installs zsh and sets it as default shell.
- Installs oh-my-zsh framework for plugins and themes.
- Installs Powerlevel9k theme and prepatched SourceCodePro font as default.
- Installs syntax highlighter and autosuggestion plugins.
- Disables right prompt and unnecessary userinfo on left prompt.
- Enable double line left prompt with diffrent icons for dir, git and vcs.
- Replace termux's default welcome message with a better looking one.
